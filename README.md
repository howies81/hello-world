Howard Spencer, struggling engineer suffering a mid-life crisis. No job, no money for house, land, car, nothing. People are saying hold on to hope, things will turn around, but that's hard to do with a hungry belly and driving your parent's car (with no money to fix it) and living in your parent's house with no way of moving out and having to depend on them to survive.
